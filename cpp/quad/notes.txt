Notes:

To compile: Might have to export OpenCV_DIR to point to the build folder of OpenCV.

Once the program starts up, the quadcopter takes off and moves up until it can be seen by the
camera.  To exit, hit ESC on the camera window to safely land.  Ctrl-C in the terminal window to
kill.

The quadcopter moves to the center of the ball plus or minus the radius of the ball.  If the ball
can't be found, the program remembers where the last ball position was.  If the quadcopter can't be
found after takeoff, the hover command is sent.


Possible problems:

-If the camera's images are very blue and seem weird, uncomment the color conversion from RGB to
 BGR and change RGB to BGR in findQuad/findBall
 
-If the quadcopter can't be found, try uncommenting the alt method redirect
 
-Takeoff/landing might not work

-Movement can be tuned in the linear y/z assignments
